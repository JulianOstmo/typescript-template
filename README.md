# TypeScript Cookiecutter Template

Quickly set up a new typescript project by running either:

```sh
cookiecutter typescript-template # This is when you have the cookiecutter cloned down locally
```

or

```sh
cookiecutter https://github.com/JulianOstmo/typescript-template
```

If you don't have cookiecutter installed you can install it by running:

```sh
brew install cookiecutter
```
